## üåü Project Overview

GadaVault is a modern, responsive e-commerce platform dedicated to connecting consumers with unique, high-quality products from independent designers and artisans. The frontend application is built to deliver a seamless, intuitive, and visually appealing user experience, ensuring that quality craftsmanship is showcased effectively.

### The Problem Solved

In today's crowded digital marketplace, authentic artisan goods often get lost among mass-produced items. GadaVault addresses this by providing a clean, curated platform that elevates the designer's story, allowing users to browse, search, and purchase unique products with confidence and trust.
